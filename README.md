# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This is my first project using JavaScript to put my basics into practice.
It is just a console game called 'Rock, Paper and Scissor' based on the famous game of the same name.
My program checks the necessary combinations needed to win a round and gives a message on the console regarding the winner of the round
The game will be played for 5 rouds
After all the 5 rounds are completed the program adds up the scores of the individual user and the score of the bot (computer)
It displays them onto the screen with an alert message

Further Developments:
1. I will be making this game a part of a webpage where many such games will be present
2. It will have a subtle user interface 

Wish me luck!
